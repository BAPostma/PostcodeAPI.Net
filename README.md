# PostcodeAPI.Net
A .NET library for consuming the Dutch postcodeapi.nu post code database. Uses RestSharp and Newtonsoft.Json.

This .NET library wraps access to the Dutch Post Code API.
It relies on RestSharp for request handling and Newtonsoft's JSON.NET library for deserialisation.

More information can be found on <http://www.postcodeapi.nu>. Access tokens can also be requested here.
To contribute to the specification of this API, join the guys over at their repo: <https://github.com/apiwise/postcodeapi>.

Any contributions are welcome in the form of pull-requests.
